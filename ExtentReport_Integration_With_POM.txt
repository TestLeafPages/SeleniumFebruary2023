4 Sections:
-----------
Section1: Setting report file, which is common for all the testcase (Step1 to Step3)
Section2: Related to each testcase (Step4)
Section3: Related each step status (Step5)

Steps to execute Basic script:
------------------------------
1. Make sure you have ExtentReport dependency in the pom.xml
2. Download the basic script file
3. Copy and paste the file under a package in eclipse
4. Create a reports folder under your project
5. Have a screenshot to test the attachment in your project
	- give appropriate snapshot path in the code
	
Steps to Integrate Extent Report:
---------------------------------
1. Create startReport() with @BeforeSuite in PSMs and add step1 to step3 code
2. Make ExtentReports as global variable
3. Create stopReport() with @AfterSuite to have extent.flush()
4. Create testDetails() with @BeforeClass for test case details code
5. Declare ExtentTest test as global variable
6. Create 4 global variables testName, testDescription, testAuthor and testCategory
7. Relace the hardcoded values with the respective variable names
8. Assign the values for the variables in the setup() in the testcases 	


Classroom:
----------
9. Create reportStep(String stepDetails, String status) in the PSM with conditional implementation for pass / fail
10. methods in pages should have try / catch implementation
11. call the reportStep() with pass status from try block & with fail status from catch block
